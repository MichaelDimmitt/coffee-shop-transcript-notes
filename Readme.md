what finding a career in coffee means to me
noticed, for everyone that works in coffee

aha moment

pivital moment that fundamentally changes how we view coffee
japan ucc coffee diner in kyoto
living in poke at the time

on the way back in the train station
ran into a row of coffee brewers

sat down, ordered a simple egg an toast breakfast with coffee
best cup of coffee he had ever had

from that point on considered coffee different

after japan living in seattle capital city neighborhood
went to cafe vita

took the coffee black - best cup of coffee
ok, coffee is really cool

moved to san francisco with a food truck event company.

trucks would gather and put on music

loved it

met tons of talented chefs but something was missing
I just was not connecting with my job, wanted to connect with my hand and do something 

blue bottom coffee ... applied
left salaried position and applied as barista

took a huge risk
after accepted, week of regret

how will I survive. how will I make this happen.

they had a farmers market outside; one of the best.

fresh fruits

it was incredible

we had 8 drippers setup ... make drip coffee all day long

camping kettles basically with gas propaine setup
barter with all different farmers and producers ... okay make their mocas

ride the bike home, with fruit on the bike as you go home. it was awesome.

went somewhere else, I was still learning coffee but they needed someone to fill manager position.
huge staff, moving pieces.

funny story, backtrack, learned steam milk and latte art
someone was constantly pulling shots ... picking up milk steaming
steam and pour at same time!

at first you do learn that skill
but eventually you find the way

gave him access to bakers, roasters, more cuppings ... really wanted to learn if was going to be in that role.

4 or 5 months later learned that blue bottle would expand to japan.

with newly aquired skills I raised my hand that I can go
they chose me with their expansion team and in 2014

we had flagship, in tokyo

downstairs with roaster and greenbean storage and upstairs? we did coffee service.

espresso drinks 70% ... on ferry
little did we know it would be drip coffee. 

we quickly learned espresso would not suffice
so was taken back to roots which was pretty fun

after expansion in tokyo we opened more stores in japan and I helped expand the brand
they eventually got purchased by another company

super greatful for the experience. but i never would have gotten there if I did not decide to cut my pay.

returned to florida for a while near sarasota.

but then, japan started calling my name
learned acehotel stub town coffee was opening in kyoto

so I reached out asked to get onboard and then ... covid
after 3 years I decided its

cant be afraid to take risks, tonight, I was nervous to talk in front of all of you
but you are all supportive

so many creatives and great people
if you want to do something just know people will support you

we are still on the first slide

so now ... I will show some photos
photo of ucc cafe in kyoto ... thought it was 10 syphin coffees setup
cafe vita ...

food truck company called off the grid
start setting up at 4 get off 2 am
next morning had a shift at 7

san francisco pour over bar with blue bottle cafe

training lab in tokyo
photo of cupping with the head roaster

photo of production line for stub town
photo of going over extraction

super energetic staff
forgot ... led to own cafe. a popup in orlando

living in charleston saw a friend build out a japanese ktruck platform
great idea lets go get a ktruck in florida

popup cart
photo of the cart

ran with a decent

the heavy in orlando ... used to be a seafood market they moved to a spot called garden tiger
we had a truck built out

photo of a super cool truck
custom furnature maker friend designed it and it worked out pretty well

without anything could go 85 miles an hour
but with everything 55 with the drag... all country road, completely white nuckle the whole time

had to drive it from orlando to here!

another full circle kind of moment
sold the truck to our friends in charleston who were the inspiration to get started with the company!

#### QUESTIONS
going from day job to ... 

tldr of zapcat is ... we were offered as a popup deal
had a normal office job
had a small roasting company back in the day

zapcat was creative outlet 
then oh man not doing day job well
not able to fully commit to zapcat

serendipitous moment
I was home inspeactor that was day job

housing market was not doing well
at that point had not paid self dollar we had put everything into it

transparency is a cool thing in coffee
morgage and 2 kids at home, still in the thick of it

so passionate, loves coffee
will make money in future

hope zapcat will make more money
definately should not do what I do

dont care about the p&l

figure out business side of it then go
but he did the inverse

but now I should probably learn what a p&l is
just kind of send it

if you are passionate it usually works out 

(switch mike)
had small money saved was not much and said
if we are going to do it you got to do it

we put everything on the credit cards
you have to work

we all work a lot and you have to know it will work out

(pass mike)
question: were you a barista before that

perq (australian cafe) - I got into coffee
was drinking frappachinos

2 group slayer on their bar
wife got job at bold bean as opening staff

back in the day bold bean protocol
wife and zapcat co-owner he was looking at and it zapped his brain

got into espreso 
when she was working there

if I buy a machine I wont need to spend money at cafe
we got super into it 

brevel dual boiler, rotary pump

(question + pass mic)
what inspired design

coffee + wine + small plate
bar citra built the interior design

scandanavia - rachel
they did an amazing job and we are lucky to be surrounded with such an environment every day

how do you go from cart to building a truck to storefront?
building a truck took 7 months

during that time met bar citra owners who were looking 

we brought a cart and did a popup
people were excited about drip offerings

it was exciting

popup went well

guess we are going to do this and move up here!

(question + pass mic)
why zapcat and why address

was doing some badd stuff in garage
800 gram production roast

nephew was 5 and super into it
have a picture of moment zapcat happened

5 minutes later he came with a cat
"you should call your company zapcat"

but we already had a name so our roast/blend we named zapcat

had so many domains
... sitting on the couch

good shakes coffee co?!??!??

then she looked at me and ... zapcat
kid was 10

redraw that cat
friend with brand as a favor

call him creative director

address origin story
moved around a lot

always changing addresses
what is an address?

the place you come home to.

what does it mean to support your baristas?
pay them well

a litte bit more than minimum wage
take them out to dinner a lot

people used to take him out for lunch
that was on the business

people want to travel and we will be short staffed
treat them how you want to be treated

company parties

still have not had year end party
when deepest in coffee nerd dom

everything in my life was 

captain cloud and their podcast
how they treat their staff , some things I thought were cool

pay higher than most 
programmed people to tip heavier

in past, totally normal deskjob but they were like cool about family
when clouds come we will close if need to but will make it happen.

barista is a notoriously high turnover job

how do you grow your customer base?
rent space from christian owner

we were lucky for a profit share model for rent
did not need to sell out on drinks

it was a side hustle so we put weirdest coffees on espresso
... still very much into coffee

so kelly did design 
and he did whatever wanted with the bar

did not need to worry about rent and sell out

really loyal people who found their cafe
stay true to what you are doing

first start out it was slow
ok. dont worry about people not going out
treat people well and serve good coffee

one of greatest joys now is when different regulars co-mingle because now they are making community

(hospitality aspect) - stigma in specialty coffee world of jerk barista
are you doing anything to go the other way

in japan motonashi , do good to others without expecting anything in return
try to greet everyone that way and provide service

they can do what they want in the space and we will provide a service

cat and cloud santa cruz california podcast (plug)
their main tenant is customer service and interaction. coffee and whatever is insane ... disney customer service
have people be your guest

wanted from podcast
tell me about your grinder
but they would always talk about culture

if someone is having a weird day or if you have a homie

capn cloud principle

if your coming in the door we are saying whatsup
eye contact is huge

but really good of making people feel is their bar when they are on their way to work
either crying or laughing

(believe in goals, where do you see zapcat or address in a year)
zapcat, no hard goals

the building is super wierd
... some stuff for me not to write down you had to be there

had to do some creative things
... another thing not to name

would love to in a year still be in that building
7 years left on release and would love to be there till they tear it to the ground

but could be canceled any time 

brush up on portuguese
going to origin for the beans for address


how do you find your roasters
passenger ... look for transperency values
subtext another great company ... going to origin all the time

roasters who we serve as a cafe

zapcat changes coffee often , have a ton of relationship coffees . would love to roast again
recently getting coffees from same producers

coffees fit our coffee program
hate it wish more focused on sustainability and origin side of it

but right now I only work with roasters who are putting transparency reports or how much we paid for this coffee

zapcat - dont care where as long as knows they paid for the coffee
coferment coffee producer can make more money

origin for zapcat would be something like a 5 year goal

(question for andrew)
stub tab - worked at large coffees
what has helped you run your small business

p&ls - spreadsheets, structure, admitadly not keeping up with them right now
need to get better at filling out spreadsheets

ceo of bluebottle purchased out, brian
ceo was on bar for hours washing dishes

showed cared for people
so andrew tries to do that as well

andrew watches valor podcast, has great resources cafe viability spreadsheet

zapcat owner grew up in entrepreneural household, but did not want dads stress
working with collective who automates p&l and book keeping

too expensive but done taxes past 3 years
irs is coming oh god

so bit bullet 350 a month and they kind of teach you
why do you both use slayer machine?
sarasota taproot moment

bold bean had a slayer they were having a moment then
did not have money for it so did not do it

fully utilize slayer machine, way finer 45 to 60 second shot times
would probably not get a steam

we weigh our dos
we weigh our yeild and use something for timing

but it can be daunting when prepping milk and talking to people
steam being able to volumetric and shot timers

address - previous jobs had machine that would break down
had a friend who designed the machine

had a friend who had slayer steam and he worked with it
digital display used to break down a lot

(thoughts on coffee as an art vs commodity)
now and then bar in nashvile (omakase coffee bar)

not sure how to make financially viable

(question for someone to journal about)
what have you learned about yourself steven and andrew?

betterhelp online therapy at zapcat

learning not to be completely vulnerable and wrap my ego in zapcat
somepeople are on ego journeys trying to kill their ego

the first time someone with a good pallete came in and value it
and then when nate came in and did not like it

steve loves zapcat
coffee is super weird 

came back and did not like it
made another thing - oh nate get this

the business is not everything about me - really easy for every shot of espresso to be this is not you
hyper focus on what you like, that is fine

having a community that is so invested
steve feels better after talking

arnold talks about transparency
taking risks and thats the only way you can get somewhere

always feel unworthy and have to deal with imposter syndrome
but hey I feel that way, keep moving forward

overcoming imposter syndrome I work at all the time

drip coffee with milk, we give him a lot of samples and today he got the coffee black
talking to people. i love to give samples out

no laptop bar
bar is reserved

weird zapcat thing
celebrity couple names

milkbar in new york
needed an approachable cereal milk latee

trevor has changed and wants funky coffee now
force people to bonus situations

help people have their coffee moment
