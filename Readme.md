Andrew Curry:  
What finding a career in coffee means to me  
Noticed, for everyone that works in coffee there is an  

aha moment  

A pivital moment that fundamentally changes how we view coffee  
for me it was at a  
japan ucc coffee diner in kyoto  
living in poke at the time  

On the way back, I was sitting in the train station and  
ran into a row of coffee brewers  

Sat down, ordered a simple egg an toast breakfast with coffee  
best cup of coffee he had ever had.  

From that point on, I considered coffee differently  

After Japan, living in Seattle's capital city neighborhood  
went to cafe vita.  

Took the coffee black - best cup of coffee  
ok, coffee is really cool.  

Moved to san francisco with a food truck event company.  

Trucks would gather and put on music  

Loved it.  

Met tons of talented chefs, but something was missing  
I just was not connecting with my job, wanted to connect with my hands and do something   

Blue bottom coffee ... applied  
Left salaried position and applied as barista  

Took a huge risk  
after accepted, week of regret  

How will I survive? how will I make this happen?  

They had a farmers market outside; one of the best.  

Fresh fruits  

It was incredible  

We had an 8 drippers setup ... make drip coffee all day long  

Camping kettles, basically, with a gas propaine setup.  
we would barter with all different farmers and producers ... okay, [I thought/said], I will make their mocas!  

Ride the bike home, with fruit on the bike as you go home. It was awesome.  

Went somewhere else, I was still learning coffee but they needed someone to fill manager position.  
huge staff, lot of moving pieces.  

Funny story, backtrack, when I learned to steam milk and do latte art  
someone was constantly pulling shots while picking up and steaming  milk  
steam and pour at same time!  

At first when you learn that skill [you think there is no way]  
but eventually you find the way  
  
[the new job ...]  
Gave him access to bakers, roasters, more cuppings ... really good if tiy wanted to learn that role.  

4 or 5 months later learned that blue bottle would expand to japan.  

With newly aquired skills I raised my hand that I can go  
they chose me with their expansion team and in 2014  

We had flagship, in tokyo  

Downstairs with roaster and greenbean storage and upstairs? we did coffee service.  

Espresso drinks 70% ... on ferry  
little did we know it would be drip coffee.   
 
We quickly learned espresso would not suffice [for the customers]  
so I was taken back to [drip coffee] roots which was pretty fun  

After expansion in tokyo we opened more stores in japan and I helped expand the brand  
they eventually got purchased by another company  
  
Super greatful for the experience. But I never would have gotten there if I did not decide to cut my pay.  
  
Returned to florida for a while; near sarasota.  
  
But then, japan started calling my name  
learned acehotel stub town coffee was opening in kyoto  
  
So I reached out asked to get onboard and then ... covid  
after 3 years I decided its [enough?]  
  
Cant be afraid to take risks, tonight, I was nervous to talk in front of all of you  
but you are all supportive  
  
So many creatives and great people  
if you want to do something, just know people will support you

Super energetic staff!!  
[oh I] forgot, ...[here is what] led to own cafe. a popup in orlando  
  
Living in charleston, saw a friend build out a japanese ktruck platform  
great idea! lets go get a ktruck in florida!  
  
Popup cart  
[photo 9] photo of the cart  
  
Ran with a decent  
  
[photo 10?] "The heavy" in orlando ... used to be a seafood market they moved to a spot called "garden tiger"  
we had a truck built out.  
  
[photo 11] Photo of a super cool truck  
custom furnature maker friend designed it and it worked out pretty well.  
  
Without anything, could go 85 miles an hour  
but with everything, 55 with the drag... all country road, completely white nuckle the whole time  
  
Had to drive it from orlando to here!  
  
Another full circle kind of moment  
sold the truck to our friends in charleston who were the inspiration to get started with the company!  
  
## QUESTION and ANSWER Session
(Steve)  
Going from day job to ...   
  
tldr of Zapcat is ... we were offered as a popup deal  
had a normal office job  
had a small roasting company back in the day  
  
Zapcat was creative outlet   
then oh man not doing day job well  
not able to fully commit to zapcat  
  
Serendipitous moment  
I was home inspeactor that was day job  
  
Housing market was not doing well  
at that point had not paid self dollar we had put everything into it  
  
Transparency is a cool thing in coffee  
morgage and 2 kids at home, still in the thick of it  
  
So passionate, loves coffee  
will make money in future  
  
Hope Zapcat will make more money  
definately should not do what I do  
  
Dont care about the p&l  
  
Figure out business side of it then go  
but he did the inverse  
  
But now I should probably learn what a p&l is  
just kind of send it  
  
If you are passionate it usually works out   
  
(switch mic)  
(Andrew)  
had small money saved was not much and said  
if we are going to do it you got to do it  
  
we put everything on the credit cards  
you have to work  
  
we all work a lot. and you have to know it will work out  
  
(pass mike)  
question to steve: were you a barista before opening zapcat?  
  
(Steve)  
[my coffee moment]  
perq (australian cafe) - I got into coffee  
was drinking frappachinos  
  
2 group slayer on their bar  
wife got job at bold bean as opening staff  
  
Back in the day, bold bean protocol  
wife and zapcat co-owner he was looking at [slayer machine]  and it zapped his brain.  
  
[Steve] got into espreso   
When she was working there  
  
[my thinking was] if I buy a machine, I wont need to spend money at cafe  
we got super into it   
  
Brevel dual boiler, rotary pump  
  
(question + pass mic)  
What inspired [your coffee shop] design  
  
(Andrew)  
Coffee + wine + small plate  
bar citra built the interior design  
  
Scandanavian - Rachel  
they did an amazing job and we are lucky to be surrounded with such an environment every day  

(question)
How do you go from cart, to building a truck, to [a] storefront?  
(Andrew)
building a truck took 7 months.  
  
During that time, met bar citra owners, who were looking [for a tenant]  
  
We brought a cart and did a popup  
people were excited about drip offerings  
  
It was exciting  
  
Popup went well.  
  
Guess we are going to do this and move up here!  
  
(question + pass mic)  
Why Zapcat and why Address  
  
(Steve)  
Was doing some badd stuff in garage  
800 gram production roast  
  
Nephew was 5 and super into it  
have a picture of moment zapcat happened  
  
5 minutes later he came with a cat  
"you should call your company Zapcat"  
  
But we already had a name so our roast/blend we named zapcat  
  
Had so many domains  
... sitting on the couch  
  
Good shakes coffee co?!??!??  
  
Then she looked at me and ... zapcat  
kid was 10  
  
Redraw that cat [we said to our kid]  
friend with brand [experience helped with the logo] as a favor  
  
Call him creative director  
  
(switch mic)  
(Andrew)  
Address origin story  
moved around a lot  
  
Always changing addresses  
what is an address?  
  
"The place you come home to"  
  
(question)  
what does it mean to support your baristas?  
(andrew)  
pay them well  
  
A litte bit more than minimum wage  
take them out to dinner a lot  
  
People used to take him out for lunch  
that was on the business  
  
People want to travel and we will be short staffed  
treat them how you want to be treated  
  
Company parties  
  
(Steve)  
Still have not had year end party  
when deepest in coffee nerd dom  
  
Everything in my life was   
  
Captain cloud and their podcast  
how they treat their staff, some things I thought were cool  
  
Pay higher than most   
programmed people to tip heavier  
  
In past, totally normal deskjob but they were like cool about family  
when clouds come we will close if need to but will make it happen.  
  
Barista's [are] a notoriously high turnover job  
  
(question)  
how do you grow your customer base?  
(Steve)  
rent space from christian owner  
  
We were lucky for a profit share model for rent  
did not need to sell out on drinks  
  
It was a side hustle so we put weirdest coffees on espresso  
... still very much into coffee  
  
So kelly did design   
and he did whatever wanted with the bar  
  
Did not need to worry about rent and sell out  
  
Really loyal people who found their cafe  
stay true to what you are doing  
  
(Andrew)  
First starting out it was slow.  
Ok, don't worry about people not going out.  
Treat people well and serve good coffee.  
  
One of greatest joys now is when different regulars co-mingle because now they are making community  
  
(question)  
(hospitality aspect) - stigma in specialty coffee world of jerk barista  
are you doing anything to go the other way?  
  
(Andrew)  
In japanese "Omotenashi", "do good to others without expecting anything in return"  
try to greet everyone that way and provide service  
  
They can do what they want in the space and we will provide a service  
  
(plug) Cat and Cloud Santa Cruz California podcast  
their main tenant is customer service and interaction. coffee and whatever is insane ... disney customer service  
have people be your guest  
  
(Steve)  
[What I] wanted from [my favorite] podcast  
tell me about your grinder!  
But they would always talk about culture  
  
If someone is having a weird day or if you have a homie  
  
Cap'n Cloud principle  
  
If your coming in the door we are saying whatsup  
eye contact is huge  
  
But [we are] really good [at] making people feel [this] is their bar when they are on their way to work  
either crying or laughing  
  
(question)  
I am a believer in goals, where do you see Zapcat or Address in a year?  
(Steve)  
Zapcat, no hard goals  
  
The building is super weird  
... some stuff for me not to write down you had to be there  
  
Had to do some creative things  
... another thing not to name  
  
Would love to in a year still be in this building  
7 years left on lease and would love to be there till they tear [the building] to the ground  
  
But [lease] can be canceled any time   
  
[?] brush up on portuguese  
(Andrew)  
Going to origin for the beans for address  
  
(question)  
How do you find your roasters?  
(andrew)  
Passenger ... look for transperency values  
subtext another great company ... going to origin all the time  
  
(Steve)  
Roasters who we serve as a cafe  
  
Zapcat changes coffee often , have a ton of relationship coffees . would love to roast again  
recently getting coffees from same producers  
  
Coffees fit our coffee program  
hate it, wish more focused on sustainability and origin side of it  
  
But right now, I only work with roasters who are putting transparency reports for [how much they paid to the farmer to buy the coffee]  
  
Zapcat - dont care where, as long as knows they paid for the coffee  
co-ferment coffee producer can make more money  
  
Origin for zapcat would be something like a 5 year goal  
  
(Question for Andrew)  
stub tab - worked at large coffees  
what has helped you run your small business?  
  
(Andrew)  
P&Ls - spreadsheets, structure, admitadly not keeping up with them right now  
need to get better at filling out spreadsheets  
  
Ceo of bluebottle purchased out, brian  
ceo was on bar for hours washing dishes  
  
Showed cared for people  
so andrew tries to do that as well  
  
(plug) Andrew watches valor podcast, has great resources cafe viability spreadsheet  
  
(Steve)  
Zapcat owner grew up in entrepreneural household, but did not want dads stress  
working with collective who automates p&l and book keeping  
  
Too expensive but done taxes past 3 years  
[was thinking] irs is coming, oh god!!  
  
So bit bullet 350 a month and they kind of teach you  
(question)  
Why do you both use slayer machine?  
(Steve)  
Sarasota taproot moment  
  
Bold bean had a slayer, [slayer was] having a moment then  
did not have money for it, so did not do it  
  
Fully utilize slayer machine, way finer 45 to 60 second shot times  
would probably not get a steam  
  
We weigh our dose  
we weigh our yeild and use something for timing  
  
But it can be daunting when prepping milk and talking to people  
steam being able to volumetric and shot timers  
  
(Andrew)  
Address - previous jobs, had machine that would break down  
had a friend who designed the machine  
  
Had a friend who had slayer steam and he worked with it  
digital display used to break down a lot  
  
(question)  
Thoughts on coffee as an art vs commodity?  
(Steve)  
Now and then bar in nashvile (omakase coffee bar)  
  
Not sure how to make financially viable  
  
(Question for someone to journal about)  
What have you learned about yourself Steven and Andrew?  
  
(Steve)  
Betterhelp online therapy [here] at zapcat  
  
  
Learning not to be completely vulnerable and wrap my ego in zapcat  
some people [at zapcat]  are on ego journeys trying to kill their ego  
  
The first time someone with a good pallete came in and value[d] [my coffee lineup/choice]  
and then when Nate came in and did not like it [broke his hart]  
  
Steve loves Zapcat  
coffee is super weird   
  
[Nate] came back and did not like it  
made another thing - oh nate [will] get this! [and he enjoyed]  
  
The business is not everything about me - really easy for every shot of espresso to be this is not you  
hyper focus on what you like, that is fine  
  
Having a community that is so invested  
(Steve feels better after talking)  
  
(Andrew)  
Andrew talks about transparency  
taking risks, and thats the only way you can get somewhere.  
  
Always feel unworthy and have to deal with imposter syndrome  
but hey, "I feel that way" - keep moving forward  
  
Overcoming imposter syndrome, I work at all the time  
  
Drip coffee with milk, we give him a lot of samples and today he got the coffee black  
talking to people. I love to give samples out  
  
No laptop bar  
bar is reserved  
  
(Steve)  
Weird Zapcat thing  
celebrity couple names  
  
Milkbar in New York [could not get friends to go to try it for him]  
needed an approachable cereal milk latee  
  
Trevor [one of his regulars]  has changed and wants funky coffee now
